Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions using Power BI:
Anomaly detection in credit card transactions is a critical process aimed at identifying uncommon or potentially fraudulent activities within credit card transactions. This procedure employs a combination of statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools, such as Power BI, to uncover irregular patterns and deviations from typical transaction behaviour. The ultimate goal is to swiftly detect and flag transactions that may be fraudulent in real-time, safeguarding the financial integrity of credit card holders and financial institutions.
